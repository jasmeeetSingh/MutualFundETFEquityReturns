#### Q3. Sharpe and Treynor ratios of ETFs vs MFs i.e. Does being passive result in better performance ratios?
#### Q4. Are ratings able to predict category outperformance?
#### Q5. Are the assumptions of Fama French Model three-factor model still valid? 
     - Do small caps outperform large caps?
